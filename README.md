# k8s-crio
Simple steps to deploy kubernetes using the cri-o container engine. Not quite ready please help!

The lab was written using AWS Ubuntu 16.04 node. The prompt is just a simple name, your 
prompt will be differrent.

At the moment I can get k8s running with the typical images, but pods using non-infrastructure 
images still has issues. I'll work on this as I have time.

Please feel free to contact me with questions or comments. Via twitter @TimSerewicz or via 
email where you replace the tilde ~ with the expected @ sign and dot: Tim~Serewicz~com

Welcome!
